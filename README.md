This project is an example of automation testing on the OrangeHRM website using Katalon Studio. The project encompasses two testing phases: functional testing.

1. Functional Testing:

     -  Login with an incorrect password
     -  Login with both incorrect username and password
     -  Login without entering a username
     -  Login without entering a password
     -  Login without entering both username and password
     -  Login with a case-sensitive username
     -  Login with a case-sensitive password.
  
  2. Navigation Testing:
     This tests whether the navigation through each menu on the admin page functions as expected.
     
  3. CRUD Testing:
     This tests whether the Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities on the employee menu work correctly.
