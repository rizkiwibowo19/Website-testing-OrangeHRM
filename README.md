This project is an example of implementing automated testing on the OrangeHRM website using Katalon Studio. The testing in this project is focused on a single phase: functional testing.

  1. Login and Logout Testing with Data-Driven Testing (DDT):
     This tests the functionality and security of the login feature to ensure it meets expected standards. The scenarios tested include:
     Successful login
     -  Login with an incorrect username
     -  Login with an incorrect password
     -  Login with both incorrect username and password
     -  Login without entering a username
     -  Login without entering a password
     -  Login without entering both username and password
     -  Login with a case-sensitive username
     -  Login with a case-sensitive password.
  
  2. Navigation Testing:
     This tests whether the navigation through each menu on the admin page functions as expected.
     
  3. CRUD Testing:
     This tests whether the Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities on the employee menu work correctly.
